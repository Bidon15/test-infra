# Tests

Currently, to test the DASing behavior with `SampleAmount=50`, we are relying on a forked version of celestia node that hard codes this configuration value (_because this value is not configureable yet_)

The version we are currently pointing at is:
```
github.com/derrandz/celestia-node v0.4.2-0.20221025143831-b31eaa3d9cdb
```
