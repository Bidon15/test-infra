# Tests

Each `*.go` follows the naming of the test-case in `docs/test-plan/test-plan-id/*`. 

In order to not clutter the test-file with different participants' steps, each dedicated directory is created to 
maintain steps of each types of participants. 

The `common` directory maintains steps for a participant that plays the same role in every of the test-case (e.g. creating a validators set).
